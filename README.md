#Awesome talks - personal watch log

I watch many online talks, I try to commit myself watching at least three new talks every week. I decided it's time to share the list and also keep track of my progress publicly. The list below is a list of talks that I really enjoyed watching and would like my friends, coworkers and anyone who is interested in it to watch too.

I'm a frontend developer so most of the topics I watch related to web development, javascript, node and other topics of sotware development around the web.

These talks are mostly about programming but not only. The list contains also other aspects of sotware engineering such as business development, startups, leadership, management, technology etc.
